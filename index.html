      <h2 class="border-top">About Paul</h2>
        <p>After graduating high school, I was went to school for Computer Networking and System Specialist. I taught myself how to build and make PCs on my own in which it intrigued me to go to PIT. Unfortunately, I didn't graduate from their in which I had to drop out to take care of family.</p>

        <p>As a student at <a href="http://thinkful.com">Thinkful</a>, I've begun my journey to becoming a software developer and couldn't be happier!

        <p>If you're looking to hire a new developer please reach out! I am so excited to work with other developers to build great software and further my knowledge in the process!</p>
